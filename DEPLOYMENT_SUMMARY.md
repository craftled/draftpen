# Pro-Only Refactoring - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All tasks completed successfully. The app has been refactored from a free/pro model to **pro-only ($99/mo) with 7-day free trials**.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Core Business Logic
- **Removed free tier entirely** - all users must have active subscription
- **Trials included** - 7-day trial users have full access
- **Polar is single source of truth** - webhook-driven subscription management

### Database Changes
- ✅ Added `trialStart` and `trialEnd` columns to subscription table
- ✅ Migration file created: `drizzle/migrations/0010_add_trial_fields.sql`

### Backend Changes
- ✅ Webhook handler captures trial data from Polar
- ✅ Subscription logic treats `status === 'active'` as having access (includes trials)
- ✅ Helper functions added: `isInTrial()`, `getSubscriptionType()`, `getDaysLeftInTrial()`
- ✅ API routes now block ALL non-subscribers
- ✅ Removed rate limiting for free users (everyone is pro)

### Frontend Changes
- ✅ Navbar shows trial badge with countdown ("Xd trial")
- ✅ UI hooks expose trial status (`isInTrial`, `daysLeftInTrial`, `subscriptionType`)
- ✅ Error messages updated to mention "7-day free trial"
- ✅ All "Upgrade to Pro" → "Start Free Trial" (in error messages)

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Database Migration
**MUST RUN BEFORE DEPLOYING CODE:**

```bash
bun run migrate
# or
npm run migrate
```

This adds the `trialStart` and `trialEnd` columns needed by the webhook handler.

### 2. Environment Variables
Verify these are set in production:
- `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `POLAR_PRODUCT_ID` (your $99/mo product)

### 3. Polar Configuration
Verify in Polar dashboard:
- ✅ Product price: $99/mo
- ✅ Trial period: 7 days
- ✅ Webhook endpoint configured
- ✅ Webhook events enabled:
  - `subscription.created`
  - `subscription.active`
  - `subscription.canceled`
  - `subscription.updated`

## 🧪 Testing Before Launch

### Critical Tests

1. **New Subscription with Trial**
   - [ ] Sign up for trial
   - [ ] Navbar shows "Xd trial" badge
   - [ ] Full access to all models
   - [ ] Settings shows trial status

2. **Trial Expiry**
   - [ ] After 7 days (or test expiry), access blocked
   - [ ] Error message prompts payment
   - [ ] Payment restores access

3. **Webhook Processing**
   - [ ] Create subscription → `trialStart` and `trialEnd` populated
   - [ ] Cancel subscription → access revoked
   - [ ] Update subscription → UI reflects changes within 5s

4. **Non-Subscriber Block**
   - [ ] Logged-out users blocked from chat
   - [ ] Logged-in without subscription blocked
   - [ ] Proper error message shown

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# On production/staging
bun run migrate
```

### Step 2: Deploy Code
Deploy all changes to production. Order doesn't matter since migration is done first.

### Step 3: Verify Webhook
Test webhook delivery from Polar:
```bash
# Check logs for:
🎯 Processing subscription webhook: subscription.active
💾 Final subscription data: { trialStart: ..., trialEnd: ... }
```

### Step 4: Monitor
Watch for:
- Subscription webhook processing (check logs)
- Trial badge appearing correctly
- No errors in API routes for subscribed users

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

### Quick Rollback (Allow Free Access)
Remove subscription check in `/app/api/search/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Comment out these lines temporarily:
// if (!lightweightUser.isProUser) {
//   return new ChatSDKError(...).toResponse();
// }
```

### Full Rollback
1. Revert all code changes
2. Database columns are additive (safe to keep)
3. Clear caches: restart app or clear Redis

   - Trial → paid conversion tracking

3. **Analytics**
   - Trial conversion rate
   - Trial usage patterns
   - Churn analysis

## ✨ Summary

**Before:** Free tier + Pro tier  
**After:** Pro-only ($99/mo) with 7-day trials

**Access Logic:**
```
Has active subscription (status === 'active')
  ├─ Has trialEnd in future → Trial user (full access)
  └─ No trial or expired → Paid user (full access)

No active subscription → Blocked
```

All systems ready for pro-only launch! 🚀
