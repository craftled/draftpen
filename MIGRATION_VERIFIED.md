## Date: October 13, 2025

### Migration Status: **SUCCESS** âœ“

---

## Schema Changes Applied

### Subscription Table - New Columns
| Column | Type | Nullable | Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|---------|
| `trialStart` | timestamp | YES | Records when trial period begins |
| `trialEnd` | timestamp | YES | Records when trial period ends |

---

## Verification Results

### âœ… Database Schema
```
trialStart:  âœ“ EXISTS (timestamp without time zone, nullable)
trialEnd:    âœ“ EXISTS (timestamp without time zone, nullable)
```

### âœ… SQL Query Test
- Direct SELECT queries with trial columns: **PASSED**
- Column metadata verification: **PASSED**
- No existing subscriptions to migrate: **OK** (count: 0)

---

## Important Notes

### ðŸ”„ Drizzle Cache
The Drizzle ORM may have cached the old schema. You should:

**Restart your dev server** to clear the cache:
```bash
# Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C)
bun run dev
```

### ðŸ“Š Current State
- No existing subscriptions in database
- Fresh start for trial support
- All new subscriptions will capture trial data

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Restart Dev Server** (if running)
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Test Trial Flow**
   - Create test subscription with trial in Polar
   - Verify webhook captures `trialStart` and `trialEnd`
   - Check navbar shows trial badge
   - Confirm trial countdown works

3. **Monitor Webhooks**
   Watch logs for:
   ```
   ðŸŽ¯ Processing subscription webhook: subscription.active
   ðŸ’¾ Final subscription data: { trialStart: ..., trialEnd: ... }
   ```

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback the columns:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "subscription" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "trialStart";
ALTER TABLE "subscription" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "trialEnd";
```

## Summary

âœ… Migration executed successfully  
âœ… Schema verified with SQL queries  
âœ… Trial columns ready for webhook data  
âœ… Code changes already deployed
